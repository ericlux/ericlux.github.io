In the summer of 2022 I had the privilege of being the instructor for [EE 364a:
Convex Optimization I](https://web.stanford.edu/class/ee364a/) at Stanford
University.

I've also enjoyed being a course assistant for
[EE 364a](https://web.stanford.edu/class/ee364a/) (2021, 2019) and [EE 263](https://ee263.stanford.edu/) (2019).
