I am a fourth year PhD student in the Electrical Engineering department at
Stanford University, advised by Professor Stephen Boyd. I am broadly
interested in convex optimization algorithms and applications to control,
machine learning, and finance. 
In my free time I like to cook for my friends and family, and occasionally try to move
[heavy objects](https://www.openpowerlifting.org/u/ericluxenberg).
